You're right to focus on this distinction. Here's a clearer breakdown of which architectural understanding approaches can be implemented without inference:
Approaches Not Requiring Inference:
Static Structure Analysis:
Analyzing tensor shapes, names, and organization patterns
Mapping tensor hierarchies and connections within model files
Identifying architectural components based on tensor dimensions
Pattern Recognition:
Detecting weight distributions and initialization patterns
Identifying architectural fingerprints from weight statistics
Recognizing common structures (attention heads, MLP blocks) from tensor arrangements
Cross-Model Knowledge Base:
Building libraries of architectural patterns across model families
Creating dictionaries mapping between equivalent tensors in different architectures
Documenting known tensor roles based on academic papers and model documentation
Metadata Extraction:
Parsing model configuration files and tensor naming conventions
Extracting architectural hints from tensor organization and dimensions
Building architecture trees from tensor dependencies
These approaches align with Tensor-Slayer's core philosophy of analyzing models without running them, focusing on static analysis of tensor files rather than dynamic behavior during inference.
